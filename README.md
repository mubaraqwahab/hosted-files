For example, the URL of [`access-to-electricity-wdi-dataset/Access_to_Electricity.csv`](./access-to-electricity-wdi-dataset/Access_to_Electricity.csv) is [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mubaraqwahab/hosted-files/main/access-to-electricity-wdi-dataset/Access_to_Electricity.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mubaraqwahab/hosted-files/main/access-to-electricity-wdi-dataset/Access_to_Electricity.csv)

**Note to self:** The files hosted here should _rarely_ change, if at all. Otherwise, you might have to include commit hashes in the URLs.
